## Sample "hello world" code for the MongoDB client-side field level encryption beta program 


**This Repository is NOT a supported MongoDB product**

Note: Code samples in this repository are _entirely_ for development & evaluation only. Note that all examples that use local key files are intended only for illustration - for production purposes, the integrated Key Management Service (KMS) option is strongly recommended. 

For complete information, please see the MongoDB [Client-Side Encryption Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/master/core/security-client-side-encryption/) and the multi-language [CSFLE MedCo tutorial](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/use-cases/client-side-field-level-encryption-guide/) for the latest information and schema & security architecture guidance.

The snippets in this repository are mean to be simple copy/paste examples to get you up and running quickly to let you explore the main features of MongoDB's client-side encryption.
